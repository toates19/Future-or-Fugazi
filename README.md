# Future-or-Fugazi
This talk (**TechOates.pdf**) examines what we might reasonably be able to expect from technology in healthcare and how we have arrived in the present. 

The first part looks at how tech companies have identified and created a market in healthcare. The second part focusses on expectations for the use of machine learning with non-imaging data.

It owes a lot to other people's ideas. These sources and some of the referecnes are listed below:
- Slide 3:	the Topol Review is [here](https://topol.hee.nhs.uk/)
-	Slide 5:	the plot in this slide uses ideas from the opening of chapter 7 of John Carreyrou's book about Theranos Bad Blood. The code and data required to make it is in this repo
-	Slide 7:	I first became aware of the "3rd culture" after reading [this essay](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/07/jeffrey-epstein-mit-funding-tech-intellectuals) by Evgeny Morozov in The Guardian 
-	Slide 11-13:	that's the Boston dataset from the MASS package in R. Code is in the repo
-	Slide 14:	I used these examples after [Collins & Moons, Lancet 2019](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(19)30037-6/fulltext)
- Slide 16:	data & code for this plot is in the repo
- Slide 17: the table is from an Eric Topol tweet I have long lost the reference to apologies
- Slide 18:	text from Wendy Ide's @guardian [review of Aniara](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/31/aniara-review-stunning-swedish-sci-fi-parable)
- Slides 20-22:	are pretty much directly lifted from @MvanSmeden talk [here](https://www.slideshare.net/MaartenvanSmeden/machine-learning-versus-traditional-statistical-modeling-and-medical-doctors)
